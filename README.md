# northwind-react
This is a small portfolio program to demonstrate React development.  It takes data from a backend web api.  The data is based on Microsoft's Northwind database.  The database is showing its age, but it is sufficient for my purposes here.  To bring it more up to date, I added 20 years to some of the dates.

The images used for the system are very low resolution, so they look very grainy.

## Downloading the code

To download the code, use `git`.

````
git clone https://github.com/nimrod-computing/northwind-react.git
````

You will then be able to view the code in any suitable editor.

## Running the code

1. Install the dependencies.

````
npm install
````

2. Run the local http server.

````
npm start
````

This will compile the code, start an http server on port 3000, and start a session in the browser.
